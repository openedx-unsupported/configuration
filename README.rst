Configuration Management
########################

This repository is a collection of tools and scripts that edx.org uses to deploy 
openedx. The purpose of this repository is to share portions of our toolchain
with the community. This repository is *not* the best way to get started running 
openedx. For that, please look at `Open EdX Installation options`_, which contains
links to the recommended paths for new installations.

**Important**: The Open edX configuration scripts need to be run as root on
your servers and will make changes to service configurations including, but not
limited to, sshd, dhclient, sudo, apparmor and syslogd. Our scripts are made
available as we use them and they implement our best practices. We strongly
recommend that you review everything that these scripts will do before running
them against your servers. We also recommend against running them against
servers that are hosting other applications. No warranty is expressed or
implied.

For more information including installation instructions please see the `OpenEdX
Wiki`_.

For info on any large recent changes please see the `change log`_.

What is in this Repo?
*********************

* `playbooks </playbooks>`__: This directory contains ansible playbooks that can
  be used to configure individual services in the openedx platform. See
  `Open EdX Installation options`_ before trying to use any of the scripts in
  this directory.
* `docker </docker>`__: This directory contains dockerfiles that can be used to 
  test that playbooks execute cleanly.  See `Makefiles <Makefiles.rst>`__ for
  Documentation on how to run these containers.
* `requirements </requirements>`__ : inputs for `pip-compile <https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools>`__
  Update files in this directory and then run ``make upgrade`` to update
  ``requirements.txt``
* `tests </tests>`__: scripts used by travis-ci to test changes to this repo
* `util </util>`__: one-off scripts or tools used to perform certain functions
  related to openedx management.
* `vagrant </vagrant>`__: vagrant tooling for testing changes to this repo.


Roadmap
*******

This repository is in ``sustained`` status.  The goal is to deprecate this codebase
and move the deployment code into the repos with the application code. 

With the adoption of containerized application platforms like `Kubernetes 
<https://kubernetes.io/>`__, the tools in this repository are complex 
and inappropriate for building small single purpose containers.

At edx.org, we are focusing on deployment of applications using `Terraform 
<https://www.terraform.io/>`__ and `Kubernetes <https://kubernetes.io/>`__.  We
hope to provide open source tooling for this soon.
