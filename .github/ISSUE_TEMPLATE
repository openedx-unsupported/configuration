## This configuration file overrides the inherited configuration file defined
## in openedx/.github/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE because this repo currently does
## not have Issues turned on, so we create this override to *only* show DEPR
## issues to users creating Issues. Once Issues are turned on and the repo is
## ready to accept Issues of all types, this file must be deleted so inheritance
## of standard openedx configuration works properly.
