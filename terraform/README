This probably makes the most sense in a private repository, but I'm adding it here toyp kick-off the Jenkins site-speed integration.  We can move it later.

Note that I've included the tfvars file intentionally as an example, but this would typically be git ignored.

Start by downloading and installing the terraform go binaries.  Run

> terraform plan 

from the sitespeed directory to see what would happen if this was run against and AWS account.
