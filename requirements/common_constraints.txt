# A central location for most common version constraints
# (across edx repos) for pip-installation.
#
# Similar to other constraint files this file doesn't install any packages.
# It specifies version constraints that will be applied if a package is needed.
# When pinning something here, please provide an explanation of why it is a good
# idea to pin this package across all edx repos, Ideally, link to other information
# that will help people in the future to remove the pin when possible.
# Writing an issue against the offending project and linking to it here is good.
#
# Note: Changes to this file will automatically be used by other repos, referencing
#  this file from Github directly. It does not require packaging in edx-lint.

# opentelemetry requires version 6.x at the moment:
# https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python/issues/3570
# Normally this could be added as a constraint in edx-django-utils, where we're
# adding the opentelemetry dependency. However, when we compile pip-tools.txt,
# that uses version 7.x, and then there's no undoing that when compiling base.txt.
# So we need to pin it globally, for now.
# Ticket for unpinning: https://github.com/openedx/edx-lint/issues/407
