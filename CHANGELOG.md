     - Role: common_vars
       - Default `COMMON_JWT_PUBLIC_SIGNING_JWK_SET` to `''`
         instead of `!!null`. Because of how this setting is handled,
         `!!null` ends up rendering as the literal string `None` instead
         of the value `null`, which causes JSON decoding to fail
         wherever the default value is used (as `'None'` is not valid JSON).
         By setting the default to a Falsy value like the
         empty string, edx-drf-extensions does not attempt to JSON-
         decode it.

       - Removed ECOMMERCE_ORDER_NUMBER_PREFIX variable

 - 2015-09-28
     - Role: edxapp
       - All of the following changes are BACKWARDS-INCOMPATABLE:
         - Renamed two top level variables SEGMENT_IO_LMS_KEY and SEGMENT_IO_KEY to SEGMENT_KEY in {lms|cms].auth.json.
         - Renamed two top level variables in roles/edxapp/defaults/main.yml.  EDXAPP_SEGMENT_IO_LMS_KEY and EDXAPP_SEGMENT_IO_KEY are now EDXAPP_LMS_SEGMENT_KEY and EDXAPP_CMS_SEGMENT_KEY respectively
         - REMOVED two top level variables SEGMENT_IO_LMS and SEGMENT_IO from {lms|cms].auth.json. We will use the existence of the SEGMENT_KEY to to serve the same function that these boolean variables served.

 - 2015-06-17
     - Role: rabbitmq
       - Removed the RABBITMQ_CLUSTERED var and related tooling. The goal of the var was to be able to setup a cluster in the aws environment without having to know all the IPs of the cluster before hand.  It relied on the `hostvars` ansible varible to work correctly which it no longer does in 1.9.  This may get fixed in the future but for now, the "magic" setup doesn't work.
       - Changed `rabbitmq_clustered_hosts` to RABBITMQ_CLUSTERED_HOSTS.

 - 2015-05-27
     - Role: edxapp
       - Removed deprecated variables EDXAPP_PLATFORM_TWITTER_URL, EDXAPP_PLATFORM_MEETUP_URL, EDXAPP_PLATFORM_LINKEDIN_URL, and EDXAPP_PLATFORM_GOOGLE_PLUS_URL in favor of EDXAPP_SOCIAL_MEDIA_FOOTER_URLS.  These variables haven't been used in edx-platform since March 17, 2015 (when https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/pull/7383 was merged).  This change is backwards incompatible with versions of edx-platform from before March 17, 2015.
       - Added EDXAPP_MOBILE_STORE_URLS and EDXAPP_FOOTER_ORGANIZATION_IMAGE variables, used in https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/pull/8175 (v3 version of the edx.org footer).


       - We now remove the default syslog.d conf file (50-default.conf) this will
       - Added EDXAPP_LMS_AUTH_EXTRA and EDXAPP_CMS_AUTH_EXTRA for passing unique AUTH_EXTRA configurations to the LMS and CMS.
 - 2015-05-11
     - Updated ansible fork with small bug fix.
       - https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/10957

       - Removed post.txt from the list of files that will have its github urls replaced with git mirror urls.

 - 2015-04-29
     - Role: edxapp

         - pip install will always run for all known requirements files.

     - Role: edx-ansible
 - 2015-04-12
       - `/edx/bin/update` no longer runs the ansible command with `--tags deploy`

 - 2015-03-23
     - Role: edxapp
       - Added newrelic monitoring capabilities to edxapp workers. Note that this is a BACKWARDS-INCOMPATABLE CHANGE, as it introduces a new key, `monitor`, to each item in `EDXAPP_CELERY_WORKERS` in `defaults/main.yml`, and plays including this role will fail if that key is not set.

 - 2015-03-05
     - Role: analytics_api, xqwatcher, insights, minos, edx_notes_api
       - Expanded `edx_service` role to do git checkout and ec2 tagging
       - Refactored roles that depend on `edx_service` to use the new interface: `minos`, `analytics_api`, `insights`, and `xqwatcher`
       - Refactored name from `analytics-api` to `analytics_api`
       - Changed location of minos' config file from `/edx/etc/minos/minos.yml` to `/edx/etc/minos.yml`
       - Added new `edx_notes_api` role for forthcoming notes api
       - This is a __BACKWARDS INCOMPATABLE__ change and will require additional migrations when upgrading an existing server. While we recommend building from scratch, running the following command _might_ work:
           rm -rf /edx/etc/minos
 - 2015-02-06
           ```
           rm -rf /edx/app/analytics-api /edx/app/ /edx/app/nginx/sites-available/analytics-api.j2 /edx/app/supervisor/conf.d.available/analytics_api.conf
           ```

     - Role: edxapp
       - Enabled combined login registration feature by default

 - 2014-12-29
     - Role: notifier
       - Refactored `NOTIFIER_HOME` and `NOTIFIER_USER` to `notifier_app_dir` and `notifier_user` to match other roles. This shouldn't change anything since users should've only been overriding COMMON_HOME.

 - 2014-12-10
     - Role: gitreload
       - New role added for running
         [gitreload](https://github.com/mitodl/gitreload) that can be used

         on disk via a hook.

     - Role: analytics-api, edxapp, ora, xqueue, xserver
       - Switched gunicorn from using an entirely command argument based
         configuration to usign python configuration files. Variables for
         extra configuration in the configuration file template, and
         command line argument overrides are available.

       - Using Django 1.7 migrate command.

 - 2014-10-15
     - Role: edxapp
       - A new var was added to make it easy ot invalidate the default
         memcache store to make it easier to invalidate sessions. Updating
         the edxapp env.json files will result in all users getting logged
         out.  This is a one time penalty as long as the value of `EDXAPP_DEFAULT_CACHE_VERSION`
         is not explicitly changed.

 - 2014-09-18
     - Role: nginx
       - New html templates for server errors added.
         Defaults for a ratelimiting static page and server error static page.

       break people who have hand edited that file.

 - 2014-08-15
     - Role: edxapp
       - Updated the module store settings to match the new settings format.

 - 2014-08-05
     - Update, possible breaking change: the edxapp role vars edxapp_lms_env and edxapp_cms_env have
       been changed to EDXAPP_LMS_ENV and EDXAPP_CMS_ENV to indicate, via our convention,
       that overridding them is expected.  The default values remain the same.

 - 2014-06-26
     - Role: analytics-api
       - Added a new role for the analytics-api Django app.  Currently a private repo

     - Logrotation now happens hourly by default for all logs.

     - Role: Edxapp
       - The repo.txt requirements file is no longer being processed in anyway.  This file was removed from edxplatform
         via pull #3487(https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/pull/3487)
