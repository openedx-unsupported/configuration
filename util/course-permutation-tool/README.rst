Course Permutation Tool for Developer Environments
########################

This is a tool to add default courses to developer environments, specifically for
devstack and sandboxes. The goal is for developers to have access to courses with
metadata that matches that in production, and to provide a way to generate course
permutations. It will be comprised of a permutations JSON file, which
includes permutation options and default values, and also a Python script that will
generate the final file that will get passed into a course creation script.
