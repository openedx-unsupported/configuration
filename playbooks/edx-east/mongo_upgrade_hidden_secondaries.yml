# Upgrades the hidden secondary in a mongo cluster if one exists
#
# This is useful for using the hidden secondary to sniff out any problems with
# your point upgrade before you upgrade your primary/secondary servers using the
# mongo_rolling_upgrade.yml play
#
# This play expects to have access to a config file where MONGO_RS_CONFIG, as described
# in the mongo_3_0 role, is defined, as well as MONGO_ADMIN_USER and MONGO_ADMIN_PASSWORD.
#
# ansible-playbook -i 127.0.0.1, mongo_upgrade_hidden_secondaries.yml -e@/path/to/config-file.yml
#
# This play uses MONGO_RS_CONFIG to find a host to connect to and fetch replset config and build an
# inventory, so you can just target localhost.
#
# If there are no hidden secondaries, the 'Upgrade hidden members' task will just skip.
