# Simple theme
#
# See documentation in README.rst

# This flag should have been called EDXAPP_SIMPLETHEME_DEPLOY
# but it would be incompatible with include_role because of
# https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/19472
# Therefore we use "include" here (instead of "include_role")
# And because the theme is only needed for the web application, we skip running
# the role for the Celery workers
- include: deploy.yml
  when: SIMPLETHEME_ENABLE_DEPLOY and (celery_worker is not defined or not (celery_worker|bool))
