# Simple theme. Creates a basic theme at deploy time.
#
# See documentation in README.rst

#
# This file contains the variables you'll need to pass to the role, and some
# example values.



# Skeleton theme. Check README.rst

# EDXAPP_COMPREHENSIVE_THEME_VERSION


# Enable/disable deploy
# This flag isn't at the edxapp role because of https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/19472
SIMPLETHEME_ENABLE_DEPLOY: False


# This variable holds the main path where the role will copy files.
# EDXAPP_COMPREHENSIVE_THEME_DIRS.0 can be
# "/edx/var/edxapp/themes" or
# "/edx/app/edxapp/themes" or
# "/edx/app/edxapp/themes/edx-platform"
# or any other.
# If you have more than 1 theme dirs, you'll need to override this internal variable
simpletheme_folder: "{{ EDXAPP_COMPREHENSIVE_THEME_DIRS.0 }}/{{ EDXAPP_DEFAULT_SITE_THEME }}"


# Define SASS variables
# Apart from giving direct values like '#123456', you may give values that use
# previously defined variables, like '$some-variable', as long as this variable
# is earlier in the list.
#
# Sample configuration:
# SIMPLETHEME_SASS_OVERRIDES:
#   - variable: main-color
#     value: '#123456'
#   - variable: action-primary-bg
#     value: '$main-color'
#   - variable: action-primary-fg
#     value: '#fff'
#   - variable: link-color
#     value: 'red'
#   - variable: action-secondary-bg
#     value: '#07f'
#
SIMPLETHEME_SASS_OVERRIDES: []

# Files from the specified directory will be copied to the static/ directory.
# This is mainly designed to include images and JS.
# Expected file structure is e.g.
# - lms
#   - images
#     - logo.png
#     - favicon.ico
#   - js
#     - myscript.js
# - cms
#   - images
#     - logo.png
#
# Paths will be transformed like this:
# lms/images/logo.png → lms/static/images/logo.png
# lms/js/myscript.js → lms/static/js/myscript.js
# etc.
#
# Sample:
# SIMPLETHEME_STATIC_FILES_DIR: "{{ role_path }}/files/example_static_dir"
SIMPLETHEME_STATIC_FILES_DIR: ""


# These files will be downloaded and included in the static directory after the
# files from SIMPLETHEME_STATIC_FILES_DIR have been copied.
# Local paths must be relative, e.g. "lms/static/images/favicon.ico"
# Example which downloads logo and favicon:
# SIMPLETHEME_STATIC_FILES_URLS:
#   - url: http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/_static/images/logo_invert.png
#     dest: lms/static/images/logo.png
#   - url: http://docs.ansible.com/favicon.ico
#     dest: lms/static/images/favicon.ico
SIMPLETHEME_STATIC_FILES_URLS: []


# This fragment will be inserted in _lms-overrides and will affect all pages
# Sample:
# SIMPLETHEME_EXTRA_SASS: |
#   .header-global h1.logo a img {
#     height: 50px;
#   }
#   .header-global.slim h2 {
#     width: 60% !important;
#   }
#   .wrapper-footer {
#     border-top: 3px solid $main-color;
#   }
SIMPLETHEME_EXTRA_SASS: ""
