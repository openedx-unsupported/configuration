# Tasks for role edx_service
# 
# Overview:
#
# This role performs the repetive tasks that most edX roles
# require in our default configuration.
#
# Example play:
#
# Rather than being included in the play, this role
# is included as a dependency by other roles in the meta/mail.yml
# file.  The including role should add the following
# depency definition.
#
# dependencies:
#   - { role: edx_service, edx_service_name: "hotg" }
#

- name: create application user
  user: >
    name="{{ edx_service_name }}"
    home="{{ COMMON_APP_DIR }}/{{ edx_service_name }}"
    createhome=no
    shell=/bin/false

- name: create edx_service app and venv dir
  file: >
    path="{{ item }}"
    state=directory
    owner="{{ edx_service_name }}"
    group="{{ common_web_group }}"
  with_items:
    - "{{ COMMON_APP_DIR }}/{{ edx_service_name }}"
    - "{{ COMMON_APP_DIR }}/{{ edx_service_name }}/venvs"

- name: install a bunch of system packages on which edx_service relies
  apt: pkg={{ item }} state=present
  with_items: "{{ edx_service_name }}_debian_pkgs"
  when: ansible_distribution in common_debian_variants

- name: install a bunch of system packages on which edx_service relies
  yum: pkg={{ item }} state=present
  with_items: "{{ edx_service_name }}_redhat_pkgs"
  when: ansible_distribution in common_redhat_variants
