# Tasks for role stop_all_edx_services
#
# Overview:
#
#   This stops all services on an edX server
#   so that everything is shutdown prior to creating
#   an AMI.
#
# Example play:
#     roles:
#       - stop_all_edx_services
#

# Hermes is not used everywhere, try to stop it if it is running.
# We ignore errors here because of the various states the process
# and machine could be in and because we do not install Hermes
# on everything.
