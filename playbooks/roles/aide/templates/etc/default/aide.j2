# These settings are mainly for the wrapper scripts around aide,
# such as aideinit and /etc/cron.daily/aide

# This is used as the host name in the AIDE reports that are sent out
# via e-mail. It defaults to the output of $(hostname --fqdn), but can
# be set to arbitrary values.
# FQDN=

# This is used as the subject for the e-mail reports.
# If your mail system only threads by subject, you might want to add
# some variable content here (for example $(date +%Y-%m-%d)).
MAILSUBJ="Daily AIDE report for $FQDN"

# This is the email address reports get mailed to
# default is root
# This variable is expanded before it is used, so you can use variables
# here. For example, MAILTO=$FQDN-aide@domain.example will send the
# report to host.name.example-aide@domain.example is the local FQDN is
# host.name.example.
MAILTO={{ AIDE_REPORT_EMAIL }}

# Set this to yes to suppress mailings when no changes have been
# detected during the AIDE run and no error output was given.
#QUIETREPORTS=no

# This parameter defines which AIDE command to run from the cron script.
# Sensible values are "update" and "check".
# Default is "check", ensuring backwards compatibility.
# Since "update" does not take any longer, it is recommended to use "update",
# so that a new database is created every day. The new database needs to be
# manually copied over the current one, though.
COMMAND=update

# This parameter defines what to do with a new database created by
# COMMAND=update. It is ignored if COMMAND!=update.
# no: Do not copy new database to old database. This is the default.
# yes: Copy new database to old database. This means that changes to the
#   file system are only reported once. Possibly dangerous.
# ifnochange: Copy new database to old database if no changes have
#   been reported. This is needed for ANF/ARF to work reliably.
COPYNEWDB=no

# Set this to yes to truncate the detailed changes part in the mail. The full
# output will still be listed in the log file.
TRUNCATEDETAILS=yes

# Set this to yes to suppress file changes by package and security
# updates from appearing in the e-mail report. Filtered file changes will
# still be listed in the log file. This option parses the /var/log/dpkg.log
# file and implies TRUNCATEDETAILS=yes
FILTERUPDATES=yes

# Set this to yes to suppress file changes by package installations
# from appearing in the e-mail report. Filtered file changes will still
# be listed in the log file. This option parses the /var/log/dpkg.log file and
# implies TRUNCATEDETAILS=yes.
FILTERINSTALLATIONS=yes

# This parameter defines how many lines to return per e-mail. Output longer
# than this value will be truncated in the e-mail sent out.
# Set value to "0" to disable this option.
LINES=1000

# This parameter gives a grep regular expression. If given, all output lines
# that _don't_ match the regexp are listed first in the script's output. This
# allows to easily remove noise from the AIDE report.
NOISE=""

# This parameter defines which options are given to aide in the daily
# cron job. The default is "-V4".
AIDEARGS=""

# These parameters control update-aide.conf and give the defaults for
# the --confdir, --confd and --settingsd options
# UPAC_CONFDIR="/etc/aide"
# UPAC_CONFD="$UPAC_CONFDIR/aide.conf.d"
# UPAC_SETTINGSD="$UPAC_CONFDIR/aide.settings.d"
