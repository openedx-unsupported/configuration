Jenkins Analytics
#################

A role that sets up Jenkins for scheduling analytics tasks.

This role performs the following steps:

-  Installs Jenkins using ``jenkins_master``.
-  Configures ``config.xml`` to enable security and use Github OAuth plugin (by
   default) or Unix Auth Domain.
-  Creates Jenkins credentials.
-  Enables the use of Jenkins CLI.
-  Installs a seed job from configured repository, launches it and waits for it
   to finish.
-  The seed job creates the analytics task jobs.

Each analytics task job is created using a task-specific DSL script which
determines the structure of the Jenkins job, e.g. its scheduled frequency, the
git repos cloned to run the task, the parameters the job requires, and the
shell script used to run the analytics task. These DSL scripts live in a
separate git repo, configured by ``ANALYTICS_SCHEDULE_JOBS_DSL_REPO_*``.

Configuration
*************

When you are using vagrant you **need** to set
``VAGRANT_JENKINS_LOCAL_VARS_FILE`` environment variable. This variable must
point to a file containing all required variables from this section.

This file needs to contain, at least, the following variables (see the next few
sections for more information about them):

-  ``JENKINS_ANALYTICS_GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_*`` or
   ``JENKINS_ANALYTICS_USER_PASSWORD_PLAIN``. See `Jenkins Security`_ for
   details.
-  (``JENKINS_ANALYTICS_GITHUB_CREDENTIAL_*`` and
   ``ANALYTICS_SCHEDULE_MASTER_SSH_CREDENTIAL_*``) and/or
   ``JENKINS_ANALYTICS_CREDENTIALS``. See `Jenkins Credentials`_ for details.
-  ``ANALYTICS_SCHEDULE_SECURE_REPO_*`` and
   ``ANALYTICS_SCHEDULE_<TASK_NAME>_EXTRA_VARS``. See `Jenkins Seed Job
   Configuration`_ for details.

End-user editable configuration
===============================

Jenkins Security
----------------

The ``jenkins_analytics`` role provides two options for controlling
authentication and authorization to the Jenkins application:

-  `Github OAuth plugin`_ (default)
-  Unix system user

Both roles control authorization permissions using the `Matrix Authorization
Strategy`_. See `Authorization`_ for details.

Github OAuth
............

To select this security mechanism, set
``JENKINS_ANALYTICS_AUTH_REALM: github_oauth``.

The `Github OAuth plugin`_ uses Github usernames and organization memberships
to control access to the Jenkins GUI and CLI tool.

To configure Github OAuth:

1. Create a `GitHub application registration`_.

   -  Application name: choose an appropriate name, e.g. edX Analytics
      Scheduler
   -  Homepage URL: choose an appropriate URL within your Jenkins install,
      usually the home page.
      e.g., ``http://localhost:8080``
   -  Authorization callback URL: Must be your Jenkins base URL, with path
      ``/securityRealm/finishLogin``.
      e.g., ``http://localhost:8080/securityRealm/finishLogin``

2. Copy the Client ID and Client Secret into these variables:

   ::

       JENKINS_ANALYTICS_GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID: <Github Client ID>
       JENKINS_ANALYTICS_GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET: <Github Client Secret>

3. Optionally add your Github username or groups to the
   ``JENKINS_ANALYTICS_AUTH_JOB_BUILDERS`` and/or
   ``JENKINS_ANALYTICS_AUTH_ADMINISTRATORS`` lists. See `Authorization`_ below
   for details.

4. | Optionally, but only with good reason, update the list of Github OAuth
     Scopes. This setting determines the Github permissions that the Jenkins
     application will have in Github on behalf of the authenticated user.
   | Default value is:

   ::

       JENKINS_ANALYTICS_GITHUB_OAUTH_SCOPES:
         - read:org
         - user:email

5. You may also update the Github OAuth Web URI and API URI values, if for
   instance, you're using a locally installed enterprise version of Github.
   Default values are:

   ::

       JENKINS_ANALYTICS_GITHUB_OAUTH_WEB_URI: 'https://github.com'
       JENKINS_ANALYTICS_GITHUB_OAUTH_API_URI: 'https://api.github.com'

Unix system user
................

To select this security mechanism, set ``JENKINS_ANALYTICS_AUTH_REALM: unix``.

This security mechanism uses the ``jenkins`` system user and password for
access to the Jenkins GUI and CLI tool.

You'll need to override default ``jenkins`` user password, please do that
carefully as this sets up the **shell** password for this user.

You'll need to set a plain password so ansible can reach Jenkins via the
command line tool.

::

    JENKINS_ANALYTICS_AUTH_REALM: unix
    JENKINS_ANALYTICS_USER_PASSWORD_PLAIN: "your plain password"

Authorization
.............

The ``jenkins_analytics`` role configures authorization using the `Matrix
Authorization Strategy`_. This strategy provides fine-grained control over
which permissions are granted to which users or group members.

Currently there are three different levels of user access configured:

-  ``anonymous``: The ``anonymous`` user is special in Jenkins, and denotes any
   unauthenticated user. By default, no permissions are granted to anonymous
   users, which forces all users to the login screen.
-  ``JENKINS_ANALYTICS_AUTH_ADMINISTRATORS``: list of members who are granted
   all permissions by default. The ``jenkins`` user is automatically added to
   this list, so that ansible can maintain the Jenkins instance.
   See `Security Note`_ below.
-  ``JENKINS_ANALYTICS_AUTH_JOB_BUILDERS``: list of members who are granted
   permissions sufficient for maintaining Jobs, Credentials, and Views.

When ``JENKINS_ANALYTICS_AUTH_REALM: github_oauth``, members of the above lists
may be GitHub users, organizations, or teams.

-  ``username`` - give permissions to a specific GitHub username.
-  ``organization`` - give permissions to every user that belongs to a specific
   GitHub organization. Members must be *public members* of the organization
   for the authorization to work correctly. Also, the organization itself must
   allow access by the Github OAuth application, which must be granted by an
   administrator of the organization. See `Github third-party application
   restrictions`_ for more information.
-  ``organization*team`` - give permissions to a specific GitHub team of a
   GitHub organization. Notice that organization and team are separated by an
   asterisk (``*``). The Github OAuth plugin documentation doesn't say so, but
   the team probably needs to be a public team.

For example, this configuration grants job builder access to all of
``edx-ops``, and admin access only to members of the
``jenkins-config-push-pull`` team within ``edx-ops``.

::

    JENKINS_ANALYTICS_AUTH_JOB_BUILDERS:
      - edx-ops
    JENKINS_ANALYTICS_AUTH_ADMINISTRATORS:
      - edx-ops*jenkins-config-push-pull

The list of permissions granted to each group is also configurable, but
exercise caution when changing.

-  ``JENKINS_ANALYTICS_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_PERMISSIONS``: Defaults to an empty list,
   indicating no permissions.
-  ``JENKINS_ANALYTICS_AUTH_ADMINISTRATOR_PERMISSIONS``: Defaults to the full
   list of available Jenkins permissions at time of writing.
-  ``JENKINS_ANALYTICS_AUTH_JOB_BUILDER_PERMISSIONS``: By default, job builders
   are missing Jenkins Admin/Update permissions, as well as access required to
   administer slave Jenkins instances. However, they are granted these
   permissions:

   -  ``com.cloudbees.plugins.credentials.CredentialsProvider.*``: Allows
      management of Jenkins Credentials.
   -  ``hudson.model.Hudson.Read``: Grants read access to almost all pages in
      Jenkins.
   -  ``hudson.model.Hudson.RunScripts``: Grants access to the Jenkins Script
      Console and CLI groovy interface.
   -  ``hudson.model.Item.*``: Allows management of Jenkins Jobs.
   -  ``hudson.model.Run.*``: Allows management of Jenkins Job Runs.
   -  ``hudson.model.View.*``: Allows management of Jenkins Views.
   -  ``hudson.scm.SCM.Tag``: Allows users to create a new tag in the source
      code repository for a given build.

The user/group lists and permissions are joined using matching keys in the
``jenkins_auth_users`` and ``jenkins_auth_permissions`` structures.

If additional groups are required, you must add them to both
``jenkins_auth_users`` and ``jenkins_auth_permissions``. This example shows the
current 3 groups, plus a fourth group whose members can view Job status:

::

    jenkins_auth_users:
      anonymous:
        - anonymous
      administrators: "{{ jenkins_admin_users + JENKINS_ANALYTICS_AUTH_ADMINISTRATORS }}"
      job_builders: "{{ JENKINS_ANALYTICS_AUTH_JOB_BUILDERS | default([]) }}"
      job_readers: "{{ JENKINS_ANALYTICS_AUTH_JOB_READERS | default([]) }}"

    jenkins_auth_permissions:
      anonymous: "{{ JENKINS_ANALYTICS_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_PERMISSIONS }}"
      administrators: "{{ JENKINS_ANALYTICS_AUTH_ADMINISTRATOR_PERMISSIONS }}"
      job_builders: "{{ JENKINS_ANALYTICS_AUTH_JOB_BUILDER_PERMISSIONS }}"
      job_readers:
        - `hudson.model.Hudson.Read`
        - `hudson.model.Item.Discover`
        - `hudson.model.Item.Read`
        - `hudson.model.View.Read`

Security Note


As mentioned above, we append the ``jenkins`` user to the
``JENKINS_ANALYTICS_AUTH_ADMINISTRATORS`` list, to allow ansible to configure
Jenkins via the CLI tool. However, when
``JENKINS_ANALYTICS_AUTH_REALM: github_oauth``, there is a risk that the owner
of the Github username jenkins use that login to gain admin access to Jenkins.
This would be a risk no matter which username we chose for this role.

Jenkins credentials
-------------------

Jenkins contains its own credential store. To fill it with credentials, we
recommend overriding these variables:

-  ``JENKINS_ANALYTICS_GITHUB_CREDENTIAL_USER``: github username, with read
   access to the secure config and job dsl repos.
-  ``JENKINS_ANALYTICS_GITHUB_CREDENTIAL_PASSPHRASE``: optional passphrase, if
   required for ``JENKINS_ANALYTICS_GITHUB_CREDENTIAL_USER``. Default is
   ``null``.
-  ``JENKINS_ANALYTICS_GITHUB_CREDENTIAL_KEY``: private key for the
   ``JENKINS_ANALYTICS_GITHUB_CREDENTIAL_USER``, e.g.
   ``"{{ lookup('file', '/home/you/.ssh/id_rsa') }}"``
-  ``ANALYTICS_SCHEDULE_SECURE_REPO_MASTER_SSH_CREDENTIAL_FILE``: path to the
   ssh key file, relative to the ``ANALYTICS_SCHEDULE_SECURE_REPO_URL``. This
   file will be used as the private key to grant ssh access to the EMR
   instances. See `Jenkins Seed Job Configuration`_ for details.

Note that because the ``ANALYTICS_SCHEDULE_SECURE_REPO_*`` isn't cloned until
the seed job is built, the ``ANALYTICS_SCHEDULE_MASTER_SSH_CREDENTIAL_ID``
credential uses ``type: ssh-private-keyfile``, which allows the credential to
be created before the private key file actually exists on the file system.

Alternatively, you may override the ``JENKINS_ANALYTICS_CREDENTIALS`` variable.
This variable is a list of objects, each object representing a single
credential. For now passwords, ssh-keys, and ssh key files are supported. Each
credential has a unique ID, which is used to match the credential to the
task(s) for which it is needed.

Default value for ``JENKINS_ANALYTICS_CREDENTIALS``, and the variables it
depends on:

::

    JENKINS_ANALYTICS_GITHUB_CREDENTIAL_ID: 'github-deploy-key'
    JENKINS_ANALYTICS_GITHUB_USER: 'git'
    JENKINS_ANALYTICS_GITHUB_PASSPHRASE: null

    ANALYTICS_SCHEDULE_SECURE_REPO_DEST: "analytics-secure-config"
    ANALYTICS_SCHEDULE_SECURE_REPO_MASTER_SSH_CREDENTIAL_FILE: "aws.pem"
    ANALYTICS_SCHEDULE_SEED_JOB_NAME: "AnalyticsSeedJob"
    ANALYTICS_SCHEDULE_MASTER_SSH_CREDENTIAL_ID: "ssh-access-key"
    ANALYTICS_SCHEDULE_MASTER_SSH_CREDENTIAL_USER: "hadoop"
    ANALYTICS_SCHEDULE_MASTER_SSH_CREDENTIAL_PASSPHRASE: null
    ANALYTICS_SCHEDULE_MASTER_SSH_CREDENTIAL_FILE: "{{ jenkins_home }}/workspace/{{ ANALYTICS_SCHEDULE_SEED_JOB_NAME }}/{{ ANALYTICS_SCHEDULE_SECURE_REPO_DEST }}/{{ ANALYTICS_SCHEDULE_SECURE_REPO_MASTER_SSH_CREDENTIAL_FILE }}"

    JENKINS_ANALYTICS_CREDENTIALS:
      - id: "{{ JENKINS_ANALYTICS_GITHUB_CREDENTIAL_ID }}"
        scope: GLOBAL
        username: "{{ JENKINS_ANALYTICS_GITHUB_USER }}"
        type: ssh-private-key
        passphrase: "{{ JENKINS_ANALYTICS_GITHUB_PASSPHRASE }}"
        description: github access key, generated by ansible
        privatekey: "{{ JENKINS_ANALYTICS_GITHUB_CREDENTIAL_KEY }}"
      - id: "{{ ANALYTICS_SCHEDULE_MASTER_SSH_CREDENTIAL_ID }}"
        scope: GLOBAL
        username: "{{ ANALYTICS_SCHEDULE_MASTER_SSH_CREDENTIAL_USER }}"
        type: ssh-private-keyfile
        passphrase: "{{ ANALYTICS_SCHEDULE_MASTER_SSH_CREDENTIAL_PASSPHRASE }}"
        description: ssh access key, generated by ansible
        privatekey: "{{ ANALYTICS_SCHEDULE_MASTER_SSH_CREDENTIAL_FILE }}"

If you wish to use an explicit SSH key instead of reading it from a file, you
could override ``JENKINS_ANALYTICS_CREDENTIALS`` like this:

::

    ANALYTICS_SCHEDULE_MASTER_SSH_CREDENTIAL_KEY: |
        -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
        ...
        -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

    JENKINS_ANALYTICS_CREDENTIALS:
      - id: "{{ JENKINS_ANALYTICS_GITHUB_CREDENTIAL_ID }}"
        scope: GLOBAL
        username: "{{ JENKINS_ANALYTICS_GITHUB_CREDENTIAL_USER }}"
        type: ssh-private-key
        passphrase: "{{ JENKINS_ANALYTICS_GITHUB_CREDENTIAL_PASSPHRASE }}"
        description: github access key, generated by ansible
        privatekey: "{{ JENKINS_ANALYTICS_GITHUB_CREDENTIAL_KEY }}"
      - id: "{{ ANALYTICS_SCHEDULE_MASTER_SSH_CREDENTIAL_ID }}"
        scope: GLOBAL
        username: "{{ ANALYTICS_SCHEDULE_MASTER_SSH_CREDENTIAL_USER }}"
        type: ssh-private-key
        passphrase: "{{ ANALYTICS_SCHEDULE_MASTER_SSH_CREDENTIAL_PASSPHRASE }}"
        description: ssh access key, generated by ansible
        privatekey: "{{ ANALYTICS_SCHEDULE_MASTER_SSH_CREDENTIAL_KEY }}"

Jenkins seed job configuration
------------------------------

The seed job creates the Analytics Jobs that will run the analytics tasks. By
default, the seed job creates all the available Analytics Jobs, but you can
disable these jobs, and set their parameters, using
``ANALYTICS_SCHEDULE_<TASK_NAME>_*``.

Currently supported analytics tasks are:

-  ``ANSWER_DISTRIBUTION``: invokes
   ``edx.analytics.tasks.answer_dist.AnswerDistributionWorkflow`` via the
   ``AnswerDistributionWorkflow.groovy`` DSL.
-  ``IMPORT_ENROLLMENTS_INTO_MYSQL``: invokes
   ``edx.analytics.tasks.enrollments.ImportEnrollmentsIntoMysql`` via the
   ``ImportEnrollmentsIntoMysql.groovy`` DSL.
-  ``COURSE_ACTIVITY_WEEKLY``: invokes
   ``edx.analytics.tasks.user_activity.CourseActivityWeeklyTask`` via the
   ``CourseActivityWeeklyTask.groovy`` DSL.
-  ``INSERT_TO_MYSQL_ALL_VIDEO``: invokes
   ``edx.analytics.tasks.video.InsertToMysqlAllVideoTask`` via the
   ``InsertToMysqlAllVideoTask.groovy`` DSL.
-  ``INSERT_TO_MYSQL_COURSE_ENROLL_BY_COUNTRY:`` invokes
   ``edx.analytics.tasks.location_per_course.InsertToMysqlCourseEnrollByCountryWorkflow``
   via the ``InsertToMysqlCourseEnrollByCountryWorkflow.groovy`` DSL.

Since running the analytics tasks on EMR requires confidential ssh keys, the
convention is to store them in a secure repo, which is then cloned when running
the seed job. To use a secure repo, override
``ANALYTICS_SCHEDULE_SECURE_REPO_URL`` and
``ANALYTICS_SCHEDULE_SECURE_REPO_VERSION``.

For example:

::

    ANALYTICS_SCHEDULE_SECURE_REPO_URL: "git@github.com:open-craft/analytics-sandbox-private.git"
    ANALYTICS_SCHEDULE_SECURE_REPO_VERSION: "customer-analytics-schedule"

The seed job also clones a second repo, which contains the DSL scripts that
contain the analytics task DSLs. That repo is configured using
``ANALYTICS_SCHEDULE_JOBS_DSL_REPO_*``, and it will be cloned directly into the
seed job workspace.

**Note:** There are two ways to specify a ssl-based github repo URL. Note the
subtle difference in the paths: ``github.com:your-org`` vs.
``github.com/your-org``.

-  git@github.com:your-org/private-repo.git ✓
-  ssh://git@github.com/your-org/private-repo.git ✓

*Not like this:*

-  git@github.com/your-org/private-repo.git ❌
-  ssh://git@github.com:your-org/private-repo.git ❌

The full list of seed job configuration variables is:

-  ``ANALYTICS_SCHEDULE_SECURE_REPO_URL``: Optional URL for the git repo that
   contains the analytics task schedule configuration file. If set, Jenkins
   will clone this repo when the seed job is run. Default is ``null``.
-  ``ANALYTICS_SCHEDULE_SECURE_REPO_VERSION``: Optional branch/tagname to
   checkout for the secure repo. Default is ``master``.
-  ``ANALYTICS_SCHEDULE_SECURE_REPO_DEST``: Optional target dir for the the
   secure repo clone, relative to the seed job workspace. Default is
   ``analytics-secure-config``.
-  ``ANALYTICS_SCHEDULE_SECURE_REPO_CREDENTIAL_ID``: Credential id with read
   access to the secure repo. Default is
   ``{{ JENKINS_ANALYTICS_GITHUB_CREDENTIAL_ID }}``. See `Jenkins Credentials`_
   below for details.
-  ``ANALYTICS_SCHEDULE_JOBS_DSL_REPO_URL``: Optional URL for the git repo that
   contains the analytics job DSLs. Default is
   ``git@github.com:edx/jenkins-job-dsl-internal.git``. This repo is cloned
   directly into the seed job workspace.
-  ``ANALYTICS_SCHEDULE_JOBS_DSL_REPO_VERSION``: Optional branch/tagname to
   checkout for the job DSL repo. Default is ``master``.
-  ``ANALYTICS_SCHEDULE_JOBS_DSL_REPO_CREDENTIAL_ID``: Credential id with read
   access to the job DSL repo. Default is
   ``{{ JENKINS_ANALYTICS_GITHUB_CREDENTIAL_ID }}``. See `Jenkins Credentials`_
   below for details.
-  ``ANALYTICS_SCHEDULE_JOBS_DSL_CLASSPATH``: Optional additional classpath
   jars and dirs required to run the job DSLs. Each path must be
   newline-separated, and relative to the seed job workspace. Default is:

   ::

       src/main/groovy
       lib/*.jar

-  ``ANALYTICS_SCHEDULE_JOBS_DSL_TARGET_JOBS``: DSLs for the top-level seed job
   to run on build. Default is
   ``jobs/analytics-edx-jenkins.edx.org/*Jobs.groovy``

-  ``ANALYTICS_SCHEDULE_<TASK_NAME>``: ``true``\ \|\ ``false``. Must be set to
   ``true`` to create the analytics task.
-  ``ANALYTICS_SCHEDULE_<TASK_NAME>_FREQUENCY``: Optional string representing
   how often the analytics task should be run. Uses a modified cron syntax,
   e.g. ``@daily``, ``@weekly``, see `stackoverflow`_ for details. Set to empty
   string to disable cron. Default is different for each analytics task.
-  ``ANALYTICS_SCHEDULE_<TASK_NAME>_EXTRA_VARS``: YML @file location to
   override the analytics task parameters. File locations can be absolute, or
   relative to the seed job workspace. You may choose to use raw YAML instead
   of a @file location, but be aware that any changes made in the Jenkins GUI
   will be overridden if the ``jenkins_analytics`` ansible role is re-run.

Consult the individual analytics task DSL for details on the options and
defaults.

For example:

::

    ANALYTICS_SCHEDULE_ANSWER_DISTRIBUTION: true
    ANALYTICS_SCHEDULE_ANSWER_DISTRIBUTION_EXTRA_VARS: "@{{ ANALYTICS_SCHEDULE_SECURE_REPO_DEST }}/analytics-tasks/answer-dist.yml"

    ANALYTICS_SCHEDULE_IMPORT_ENROLLMENTS_INTO_MYSQL: true
    ANALYTICS_SCHEDULE_IMPORT_ENROLLMENTS_INTO_MYSQL_EXTRA_VARS:
      TASKS_REPO: "https://github.com/open-craft/edx-analytics-pipeline.git"
      TASKS_BRANCH: "analytics-sandbox"
      CONFIG_REPO: "https://github.com/open-craft/edx-analytics-configuration.git"
      CONFIG_BRANCH: "analytics-sandbox"
      JOB_NAME: "ImportEnrollmentsIntoMysql"
      JOB_FREQUENCY: "@monthly"
      CLUSTER_NAME: "AnswerDistribution"
      EMR_EXTRA_VARS: "@/home/jenkins/emr-vars.yml"  # see [EMR Configuration](#emr-configuration)
      FROM_DATE: "2016-01-01"
      TASK_USER: "hadoop"
      NOTIFY_EMAIL_ADDRESSES: "staff@example.com

EMR Configuration
.................

The ``EMR_EXTRA_VARS`` parameter for each analytics task is passed by the
analytics task shell command to the ansible playbook for provisioning and
terminating the EMR cluster.

Because ``EMR_EXTRA_VARS`` passes via the shell, it may reference other
analytics task parameters as shell variables, e.g. ``$S3_PACKAGE_BUCKET``.

**File path**

The easiest way to modify this parameter is to provide a ``@/path/to/file.yml``
or ``@/path/to/file.json``. The file path must be absolute, e.g.,

::

    ANALYTICS_SCHEDULE_IMPORT_ENROLLMENTS_INTO_MYSQL_EXTRA_VARS:
      EMR_EXTRA_VARS: '@/home/jenkins/emr-vars.yml'

Or relative to the analytics-configuration repo cloned by the analytics task,
e.g.,

::

    ANALYTICS_SCHEDULE_IMPORT_ENROLLMENTS_INTO_MYSQL_EXTRA_VARS:
      EMR_EXTRA_VARS: '@./config/emr-vars.yml'

To use a path relative to the analytics task workspace, build an absolute path
using the ``$WORKSPACE`` variable provided by Jenkins, e.g.,

::

    ANALYTICS_SCHEDULE_IMPORT_ENROLLMENTS_INTO_MYSQL_EXTRA_VARS:
      EMR_EXTRA_VARS: '@$WORKSPACE/analytics-secure-config/emr-vars.yml'

**Raw JSON**

The other option, utilised by the DSL ``EMR_EXTRA_VARS`` default value, is to
use a JSON string. Take care to use a *JSON string*, not raw JSON itself, as
YAML is a JSON superset, and we don't want the JSON to be parsed by ansible.

Also, because formatting valid JSON is difficult, be sure to run the text
through a JSON validator before deploying.

As with file paths, the JSON text can use analytics task parameters as shell
variables, e.g.,

::

    ANALYTICS_SCHEDULE_IMPORT_ENROLLMENTS_INTO_MYSQL_EXTRA_VARS:
      AUTOMATION_KEYPAIR_NAME: 'analytics-sandbox'
      VPC_SUBNET_ID: 'subnet-cd1b9c94'
      EMR_LOG_BUCKET: 's3://analytics-sandbox-emr-logs'
      CLUSTER_NAME: 'Analytics EMR Cluster'
      EMR_EXTRA_VARS: |
        {
          "name": "$CLUSTER_NAME",
          "keypair_name": "$AUTOMATION_KEYPAIR_NAME",
          "vpc_subnet_id": "$VPC_SUBNET_ID",
          "log_uri": "$EMR_LOG_BUCKET"
        }

Other useful variables
----------------------

-  ``JENKINS_ANALYTICS_CONCURRENT_JOBS_COUNT``: Configures number of executors
   (or concurrent jobs this Jenkins instance can execute). Defaults to ``2``.

General configuration
=====================

Following variables are used by this role:

Variables used by command waiting on Jenkins start-up after running
``jenkins_master`` role:

::

    jenkins_connection_retries: 60
    jenkins_connection_delay: 0.5

Auth realm
----------

Jenkins auth realm encapsulates user management in Jenkins, that is:

-  What users can log in
-  What credentials they use to log in

Realm type stored in ``jenkins_auth_realm.name`` variable.

In future we will try to enable other auth domains, while preserving the
ability to run cli.

Unix Realm
..........

For now only ``unix`` realm supported -- which requires every Jenkins user to
have a shell account on the server.

Unix realm requires the following settings:

-  ``service``: Jenkins uses PAM configuration for this service. ``su`` is a
   safe choice as it doesn't require a user to have the ability to login
   remotely.
-  ``plain_password``: plaintext password, **you must change** default values.

Example realm configuration:

::

    jenkins_auth_realm:
      name: unix
      service: su
      plain_password: jenkins

Seed job configuration
----------------------

Seed job is configured in ``jenkins_seed_job`` variable, which has the
following attributes:

-  ``name``: Name of the job in Jenkins.
-  ``time_trigger``: A Jenkins cron entry defining how often this job should
   run.
-  ``removed_job_action``: what to do when a job created by a previous run of
   seed job is missing from current run. This can be either ``DELETE``
   or\ ``IGNORE``.
-  ``removed_view_action``: what to do when a view created by a previous run of
   seed job is missing from current run. This can be either ``DELETE``
   or\ ``IGNORE``.
-  ``scm``: Scm object is used to define seed job repository and related
   settings. It has the following properties:
-  ``scm.type``: It must have value of ``git``.
-  ``scm.url``: URL for the repository.
-  ``scm.credential_id``: Id of a credential to use when authenticating to the
   repository. This setting is optional. If it is missing or falsy, credentials
   will be omitted. Please note that when you use ssh repository url, you'll
   need to set up a key regardless of whether the repository is public or
   private (to establish an ssh connection you need a valid public key).
-  ``scm.target_jobs``: A shell glob expression relative to repo root selecting
   jobs to import.
-  ``scm.additional_classpath``: A path relative to repo root, pointing to a
   directory that contains additional groovy scripts used by the seed jobs.

Example scm configuration:

::

    jenkins_seed_job:
      name: seed
      time_trigger: "H * * * *"
      removed_job_action: "DELETE"
      removed_view_action: "IGNORE"
      scm:
        type: git
        url: "git@github.com:edx/jenkins-job-dsl-internal.git"
        credential_id: "github-deploy-key"
        target_jobs: "jobs/analytics-edx-jenkins.edx.org/*Jobs.groovy"
        additional_classpath: "src/main/groovy"

Known issues
************

1. Playbook named ``execute_ansible_cli.yaml``, should be converted to an
   Ansible module (it is already used in a module-ish way).
2. Anonymous user has discover and get job permission, as without it
   ``get-job``, ``build <<job>>`` commands wouldn't work. Giving anonymous
   these permissions is a workaround for transient Jenkins issue (reported
   `couple`_ `of`_ `times`_).
3. We force unix authentication method -- that is, every user that can login to
   Jenkins also needs to have a shell account on master.
