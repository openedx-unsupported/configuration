# The Origin request header indicates where a fetch originates from. It doesn't include any path information,
# but only the server name (e.g. https://www.example.com).
# See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Origin for details.

# Here we set the value that is included in the Access-Control-Allow-Origin response header. If the origin is one
# of our known hosts--served via HTTP or HTTPS--we allow for CORS. Otherwise, we set the "null" value, disallowing CORS.
