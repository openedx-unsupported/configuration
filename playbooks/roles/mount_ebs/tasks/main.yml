# Tasks for role mount_dbs
#
# Overview:
#
# This role ensures that the correct EBS volumes are mounted to the right locations.
# If the volumes are already mounted to the correct place, this role does nothing.

# This task will be skipped if UNMOUNT_DISKS is false, causing the next task
# to error if the disk has the wrong fstype but is already mounted
- name: Unmount disk if fstype is wrong
  mount:
    name: "{{ (ansible_mounts | selectattr('device', 'equalto', item.device) | first | default({'mount': None})).mount }}"
    src: "{{ (ansible_mounts | selectattr('device', 'equalto', item.device) | first | default({'device': None})).device }}"
    fstype: "{{ (ansible_mounts | selectattr('device', 'equalto', item.device) | first | default({'fstype': None})).fstype }}"
    state: unmounted
  when: "{{ UNMOUNT_DISKS and (ansible_mounts | selectattr('device', 'equalto', item.device) | first | default({'fstype': None})).fstype != item.fstype }}"
  with_items: "{{ volumes }}"

# Noop & reports "ok" if fstype is correct
# Errors if fstype is wrong and disk is mounted (hence above task)
- name: Create filesystem
  filesystem:
    dev: "{{ item.device }}"
    fstype: "{{ item.fstype }}"
    # Necessary because AWS gives some ephemeral disks the wrong fstype by default
    force: true
  with_items: "{{ volumes }}"

# This can fail if one volume is mounted on a child directory as another volume
# and it attempts to unmount the parent first.  This is generally fixable by rerunning.
# Order is super dependent here, but we're iterating ansible_mounts (in order to identify
# all current mounts in the system) not volumes, which would be reversible.
# Possibly fixable by saving this list of unmounts off and comparing it to volumes, but this
# task rarely runs, since on server setup, the disks are unmounted, and in we won't
# be unmounting disks unless you set UNMOUNT_DISKS to true.
- name: Unmount disks mounted to the wrong place
  mount:
    name: "{{ item.mount }}"
    src: "{{ item.device }}"
    fstype: "{{ item.fstype }}"
    state: unmounted
  when:
    UNMOUNT_DISKS and
    volumes | selectattr('device', 'equalto', item.device) | list | length != 0 and
    (volumes | selectattr('device', 'equalto', item.device) | first).mount != item.mount
  with_items: "{{ ansible_mounts }}"

# If there are disks we want to be unmounting, but we can't because UNMOUNT_DISKS is false
# that is an errorable condition, since it can easily allow us to double mount a disk.
- name: Check that we don't want to unmount disks when UNMOUNT_DISKS is false
  fail: msg="Found disks mounted in the wrong place, but can't unmount them.  This role will need to be re-run with -e 'UNMOUNT_DISKS=True' if you believe that is safe."
  when:
    not UNMOUNT_DISKS and
    volumes | selectattr('device', 'equalto', item.device) | list | length != 0 and
    (volumes | selectattr('device', 'equalto', item.device) | first).mount != item.mount
