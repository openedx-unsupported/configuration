# Tasks for role edx_ansible
#
# Overview:
#
# This is an edx_ansible role that installs edx_ansible :)
# The purpose is to install edx_ansible on a server so
# that it can be updated locally.
#
# This role will also drop some helper scripts that
# for running edx_ansible tasks
#
# Example play:
#
#
#
- name: create application user
  user: >
    name="{{ edx_ansible_user }}"
    home="{{ edx_ansible_app_dir }}"
    createhome=no
    shell=/bin/false

- name: create edx_ansible app and venv dir
  file: >
    path="{{ item }}"
    state=directory
    owner="{{ edx_ansible_user }}"
    group="{{ common_web_group }}"
  with_items:
    - edx_ansible_app_dir
    - edx_ansible_data_dir
    - edx_ansible_venvs_dir
