# Tasks for role lets_encrypt
# 
# Overview:
# 
# Automatically install SSL certificates for a list of domains
# using the Let's Encrypt service. Certificates are automatically
# installed in nginx and a renewal check is scheduled to run 
# twice daily, to check for expiry/revocation. Updated certificates
# are automatically installed where required.
#
# This uses the certbot-auto script pulling from the current master 
# branch at github.com/certbot/certbot.
#
# There is currently no plugin for nginx, so this implementation
# uses the webroot method for ACME authorisation. This works
# by placing a secret file under ./well-known/ in the web root.
# This path is served direct from the nginx web root folder
# (see nginx configuration).
#
# The nginx service must be running for this to work. For best results
# install nginx with NGINX_SSLNGINX_SSL=true. This will start the server
# using a self-signed insecure certificate which this play will replace. 
#
# Downloaded certificates/keys are symlinked to /etc/ssl/certs and 
# /etc/ssl/private respectively and the nginx configuration 
# /etc/nginx/ssl-certs.conf is rewritten to point to the correct files.
#
# Multiple domains will receive a single shared certificate.
#
# Finally, the nginx service is restarted to load the new certificates.
#
# Dependencies:
#
# * nginx (running; SSL enabled for auto-certificate install)
# * git
# 
# Example play:
#
# ansible-playbook ./run_role.yml -i '<ip-addr>,' -e '{"role":"lets_encrypt","LETS_ENCRYPT_DOMAINS":["www1.example.org","www2.example.org"]}'
