# Install Python packages used for testing the edX Android app on Jenkins
# Note: normally, we use a virtual environment for pip installs on a Jenkins 
# worker, but since this is the only instance of python being used on the machine
# we install them as system packages. If we start requiring more python, or
# add other jobs to this worker, please reconsider this.
