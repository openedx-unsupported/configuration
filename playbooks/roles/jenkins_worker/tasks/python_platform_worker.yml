# Install the platform requirements using pip.
# Installing the platform requirements using pip-accel
# would allow the binary distributions to be downloaded from S3
# rather than compiled each time. This was previously enabled,
# but reverted back to pip because the current version of pip-accel
# (0.22.4) is only compatible with pip >= 1.4, < 1.5 and the current
# version of pip in edx-platform is 6.0.8.
