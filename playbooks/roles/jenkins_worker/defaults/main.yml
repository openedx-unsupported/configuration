# Pip-accel itself and other workarounds that need to be installed with pip
pip_accel_reqs:
  # Install Shapely with pip as it does not install cleanly
  # with pip-accel because it has a weird setup.py
  - "Shapely==1.2.16"
  # Install unittest2 which is needed by lettuce
  # but also pip-accel has trouble with determining that.
  # unittest2>=0.8.0 (from testtools>=0.9.34->python-subunit->lettuce==0.2.20)
  - "unittest2>=0.8.0"
  # There is a bug in pip 1.4.1 by which --exists-action is broken.
  # This is fixed in pip 1.5.x, but alas pip-accel is not yet compatible with pip 1.5.x.
  # Remove when we can upgrade to a version of pip-accel that supports pip 1.5.x.
