# Tasks for role vhost
#
# Overview:
#
# This task is to contain tasks that should be run in vhost
# vitualation environments like AWS and Vagrant, but not in
# containers.  You typically would not run this role
# independently

# to ensure that all logs are compressed and synced before shutting down the server.
