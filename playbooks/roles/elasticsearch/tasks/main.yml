# Dependencies:

#   * common
#
# Example play:
#
# This role can be used to do a single-server or clustered
# installation of the elasticsearch service.  When a cluster
# is being installed, there are two important things that
# you must know.

# The ELASTICSEARCH_CLUSTERED var must be true.

# All hosts targeted by your play will be cluster peers.
# Elasticsearch will determine who the master should be.
#
# Ansible provides handy set operators for use in the
# plays host declaration, as seen in the following example.
#
# -  hosts: tag_role_elasticsearch:&tag_environment_stage
#    roles:
#    - common
#    - elasticsearch
