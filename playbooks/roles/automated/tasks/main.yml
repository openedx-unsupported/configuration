# Tasks for role automated
#
# Overview:
#
# This role is included as a dependency by other roles which provide
# automated jobs.  Automation occurs over ssh.  The automator user is
# is allowed to run explicitly listed commands via sudo.
#
# Dependencies:
#
# This role depends upon variables provided by an including role
# via the my_role/meta/main.yml file.  Includes take the following forms:
#
# For example, the edxapp role might designate that ecom and analytics users
# are allowed to run specific management commands on edxapp instancs.
#
# EDXAPP_AUTOMATED_USERS:
#   ecom:
#     sudo_commands:
#       - command: "/edx/app/edxapp/venvs/edxapp/bin/python /edx/app/edxapp/edx-platform/manage.py lms migrate --list --settings=aws"
#         sudo_user: "edxapp"
#       - command: "/edx/app/edxapp/venvs/edxapp/bin/python /edx/app/edxapp/edx-platform/manage.py cms migrate --list --settings=aws"
#         sudo_user: "edxapp"
#     authorized_keys:
#       - 'ssh-rsa <REDACTED> ecom+admin@example.com'
#       - 'ssh-rsa <REDACTED> ecom+devel@example.com'
#   analytics:
#     sudo_commands:
#       - command: "/edx/app/edxapp/venvs/edxapp/bin/python /edx/app/edxapp/edx-platform/manage.py lms help --settings=aws"
#         sudo_user: "edxapp"
#     authorized_keys: ['ssh-rsa <REDACTED> analytics@example.com']
#
# The play for the role enabling automation should include the role like so
#
#  - role: automated
#    AUTOMATED_USERS: "{{ EDXAPP_AUTOMATED_USERS | default({}) }}"
#
