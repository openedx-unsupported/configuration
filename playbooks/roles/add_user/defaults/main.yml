# Example play:
#
# Rather than being included in the play, this role
# is included as a dependency by other roles in the meta/main.yml
# file.  The including role should add the following
# dependency definition.
#
# dependencies:
#   - role: add_user
#     user_name: edx-themes
#     user_home: /edx/etc/edx-themes
#     group_name: edx-themes
#     dirs:
#       - {path: /edx/var/edx-themes, owner: 'edx-themes', group: "edx-themes", mode: "0646"}
#       - {path: /edx/etc/edx-themes, owner: 'edx-themes', group: "edx-themes", mode: "0664"}
#       - ...
