# This playbook will check for migrations that need to be run for Django applications within a larger
# Django application. If migrations exist, it will run the migrations while saving the output as an artifact.
#
# The playbook uses the Django management commands found in this Django app repo:
# https://github.com/edx/edx-django-release-util
# So the Django app above needs to be installed in the Django app being checked for migrations.
#
# Required variables for this playbook:
#
#   - APPLICATION_PATH                - the top-level path of the Django application; the application lives underneath
#                                       this directory in a directory with the same name as APPLICATION_NAME.
#                                       NOTE: It is assumed that edx-django-release-util is one of its INSTALLED_APPS.
#   - APPLICATION_NAME                - The name of the application that we are migrating.
#   - APPLICATION_USER                - user which is meant to run the application
#   - ARTIFACT_PATH                   - the path where the migration artifacts should be copied after completion
#   - HIPCHAT_TOKEN                   - API token to send messages to hipchat
#   - HIPCHAT_ROOM                    - ID or name of the room to send the notification
#   - HIPCHAT_URL                     - URL of the hipchat API  (defaults to v1 of the api)
#
# Other variables:
#   - unapplied_migrations_output     - the filename where the unapplied migration YAML output is stored
#   - migration_output                - the filename where the migration output is saved
#
# Example command line to run this playbook:
#    ansible-playbook -vvvv -i "localhost," -c local \
#       -e @overrides.yml \
#       run_migrations.yml
#
